Stone originated the interchangeable integrated-module hydraulic system. His concept was simple but powerful. It eliminated the need for complex and expensive power take-off pumps and drastically reduced the cost for hydraulic applications that required less horsepower.\n\nHerb stressed Value, Quality and Performance in his power units, which is a virtue still shared at Stone today. Stone units use components that ensure long life and quality which customers expect from a market leader.\n\nStone offers one of the widest ranges of AC and DC power units in the industry. The power units are designed to solve a myriad of application requirements. There are tens of millions of Stone units in service today, serving markets around the globe. In fact, Stone personnel are strategically located in offices around the world to serve the global marketplace.\n\nStone’s application engineering department provides collaborative engineered solutions for whatever challenge your application presents.
