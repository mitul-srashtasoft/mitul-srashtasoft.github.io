They are designed and manufactured to exceed international standards for accuracy.\n\nIn addition to the normal 'adjustable' torque wrenches, Norbar offer Production 'P' Type versions which can be pre-set and dedicated to aapplication. This setting system is designed to discourage unauthorized alteration.\n\nAll Norbar torque wrenches are offered as standard with a quality ratchet. For applications where interchangeable end fittings are required, 'Torque Handles' are also available in various models up to 650 N•m.\n\n[https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/torque-wrenches/category_multid/1](https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/torque-wrenches/category_multid/1)\n","id":"602657f0865eb104acaa1943","img":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/no1_9ea94d00c2-424efcc0dba6a83fcbf2fdea73855200.jpg"}}}}},{"name":"Manual Torque Multiplier","description":"Norbar gearboxes are built to an extremely high standard of precision. All gears rotate on needle roller bearings about hardened and ground journal pins. As a result, NorbarHand Torques can be relied upon to have a torque multiplication accuracy of +/-4%, throughout the operating range, taking the uncertainty out of high torque tightening.\n\nNo gearbox is 100% efficient and so the velocity ratio (the number of turns that the input has to make to achieve one revolution of the output) is not the same as the torque multiplication ratio. Norbar multipliers are engineered such that each gear stage has a velocity ratio of typically 5.45:1 which results in a true torque multiplication factor of 5:1.\n\nTorque output calculations are therefore a matter of simple arithmetic with little risk of incorrect bolt loading due to conversion errors. Other manufacturer's multipliers often require graphs or formulae to calculate the input torque to achieve a particular output.\n\nThe NorbarHand Torque is the most comprehensive multiplier range available. Standard products are available up to 47,500 N•m (35,000 lbf•ft) and 'specials' to 300,000 N•m (220,000 lbf•ft). A range of 'nose extensions' for reaching difficult to access bolts and full range of torque transducers for highly accurate torque monitoring are available.\n\nWe also have a large distribution network that can offer local sales and service support in over 150 countries.\n\n\n[https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/manual-torque-multipliers/category_multid/2](https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/manual-torque-multipliers/category_multid/2)\n\n","id":"60265855865eb104acaa1946","img":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/no2_f4db8c9402-605acc5e1a368c9d6a1307cd77dd3b5d.jpg"}}}}},{"name":"Pneumatic Torque Wrenches","description":"Hand operated torque multipliers are ideal for low volume or intermittent use or when there is no power source available. However, for production lines or whenever a large number of bolts is involved, a powered multiplier will save a considerable amount of time.\n\nPneuTorque operation is quiet - less than 85dB(A) with absolutely no impacting. These two factors make PneuTorques comfortable for the operator to use, reducing fatigue and consequently increasing safety.\n\nPneuTorques provide accurate torque control - on a given joint they will stall repeatably to within ±5%. Using electronic shut off, this repeatability can be improved to ±2%.\n\nThe PneuTorque consists of a robust air motor driving a Norbar multiplier with three or more stages of epicyclic gearing.\n\nTorque control is achieved by adjustment of the air pressure. An air pressure versus torque graph and a calibration certificate is supplied with each tool and allows specific torque values to be set. For more critical applications, PneuTorques can be fitted with a torque transducer and the precise torque output displayed. The tool can then be shut off at the desired torque either manually or automatically using suitable control circuitry.\n\nModels are available up to 300,000 N•m (220,000 lbf•ft).\n\n\n[https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/pneumatic-torque-multipliers/category_multid/109](https://www.norbar.com/en-gb/products/view/nsubcategory/categoryname/pneumatic-torque-multipliers/category_multid/109)","id":"60265eec865eb104acaa1949","img":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/no3_7f736b83d9-5b9187c0c5f764d5e170527e58fe7ec9.jpg"}}}}}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"Norbar"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1711619253","3117012448","390766455","845942836"]}
