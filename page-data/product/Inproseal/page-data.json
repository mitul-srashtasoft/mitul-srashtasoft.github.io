No matter the size or complexity of the application, Inpro/Seal’s technical experts can design a custom solution for your equipment.\n\nBearing failures lead to expensive downtime and lost production. With Inpro/Seal Bearing Isolators you can reduce maintenance costs and double the lifetime of your rotating equipment.\n\nThe Inpro/Seal Bearing Isolator is a two part dynamic seal consisting of a stator and a rotor attached to the shaft. The rotor and stator form a non-contacting compound labyrinth seal with no wearing parts – ensuring permanent protection. Multiple designs and custom engineering capabilities provide customers with the right solution for your application and operating environment.\n\nThe VB45-S Bearing Isolator is the new standard in Bearing Isolator Technology. This unique design provides IP66 rated contamination protection in a small 0.625 in. (15.88 mm) overall length. For more robust protection, the new VB45-U Bearing Isolator provides IP66 rated contamination protection and eliminates lubrication loss for both oil or grease lubricated equipment while also accommodating axial movement.\n\n**FEATURES & BENEFITS:**\n\nPatented bearing isolator design features protect in two ways. Here’s how…\n\n- ubricant is captured in the inner portion of the labyrinth and flows back to the bearing housing. Lubricant is captured in    the inner portion of the labyrinth and flows back to the bearing housing.\n- Outside contamination attempting to enter the bearing housing is captured in the outer labyrinth paths and expelled through a port in the rotor by centrifugal force and gravity.\n- Non-wearing, non-contacting, permanent bearing protection\n- Custom engineered for your specific application and operating environment\n- Split designs for ease of installation\n- Patented VBX Ring blocks moisture and condensation created by heating/cooling of bearing enclosures\n- Same day shipments available on most products, including new designs\n- Unconditional performance guarantee\n\n**Quote Request**\n\nSleeve Bearing\n\n[https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=e6f84855fb86bf7b70d23c125f515537&download](https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=e6f84855fb86bf7b70d23c125f515537&download)\n\nSteam Turbine\n\n[https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=558354634daa77f7cf2dd4337594f2bf&download](https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=558354634daa77f7cf2dd4337594f2bf&download)\n\nGearbox\n\n[https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=fe1811958fc05c606770b183cacef072&download](https://www.inpro-seal.com/includes/systems/docs/loadFile.php?FID=fe1811958fc05c606770b183cacef072&download)\n\n**Applications**\n\nThe Inpro/Seal Bearing Isolator is a unique barrier for contamination ingress and lubrication retention for bearings installed in pumps, motors, gearboxes, pillow blocks, steam turbines, sleeve-bearing motors, paper machine rolls, and many other types of rotating equipment.\n\nNo matter the size or complexity of your application, Inpro/Seal can design an isolator to fit your specifications.\n\n[https://www.inpro-seal.com/en_US/system-and-bearing-protection/permanent-bearing-protection](https://www.inpro-seal.com/en_US/system-and-bearing-protection/permanent-bearing-protection)\n\n\n\n","id":"60263d98865eb104acaa1921","img":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"src":"/static/ie1_8158525356-dc1465ab01a4b40d822e106e8e9e0757.jpg"}}}}},{"name":"Air Mizer","description":"Inpro/Seal AM (Air Mizer®) Solutions are complete non-contacting shaft seals designed to prevent product loss, harmful emissions, and contamination over the lifetime of your rotating equipment.\n\nProduct loss and contamination can be costly - resulting in downtime, unsafe working conditions, and maintenance nightmares. AM Solutions™ shaft seals use a positive purge of air, or inert gas, as the sealing medium to create an effective seal without any wearing contact surfaces.\n\nSlow-speed, low-pressure applications challenge traditional shaft sealing methods. Only AM Solutions shaft seals fully articulate to accommodate radial run-out, axial movement, and angular misalignment simultaneously.\n\nInpro/Seal AM Solutions shaft seals offer a variety of designs and features to fit your specific applications and operating environments.

Designed as a drop-in replacement for existing carbon rings, the Sentinel FBS eliminates costly casing modifications and rotor removal for seal installation.\n\nThe Sentinel FBS is comprised of densely packed and flexible metallic bristles that bend with changing clearances between rotating and stationary surfaces. The brush serves as the primary shaft seal while a carbon element provides face sealing in the turbine’s casing. This unique technology provides an extra layer of protection that slows down the natural wear of downstream carbon rings – reducing maintenance, downtime and steam loss. Self-centering and lightweight, the Inpro/Seal Sentinel FBS's compliant brush allows \"wear-in\" for an optimum fit, providing predictable steam leakage over an extended operating life compared to carbon rings.\n\nNow available for multiple manufactureres, including Elliott (YR turbines), Turbodyne, Terry, Coppus, Skinner, Worthington and Murray. Other designs are available upon request. For more information, contact your local Inpro/Seal Representative here.\n\nAs a drop-in replacement for carbon rings on process steam turbines, the Sentinel FBS only takes minutes to install.
