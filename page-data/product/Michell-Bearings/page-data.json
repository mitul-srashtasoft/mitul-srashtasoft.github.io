In the same year, AGM Michell patented a type of bearing in which the load was carried upon hydrodynamic oil films generated by a series of pivoting white metal (or babbitt) faced pads. The principle was applied to both thrust and journal bearings and is now universally known as the Michell ","product_items":[{"name":"Bearing Internals","description":"Michell Bearings offers several standard ranges of bearing internals for both thrust (Omega, Omega Equalised and Self Equalising) and Radial Journal Pad Unit (JPU) applications.
